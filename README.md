<br>Hello, I'm Amelia. I've always considered myself as a data scientist and programmer in training because how rapidly the technology industry evolves. In my previous life, I graduated with Honors from NYU Stern School of Business where I majored in Finance and Statistics. After navigating investment banking, FinTech and EdTech, I decided to dive into the world of data by pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Data Science at University of British Columbia. In the future, I am looking forward to exploring the endless possibilities that lie within the captivating world of data analytics and machine learning as an avid learner and collaborator, alongside like-minded peers and talented industry pioneers. ðŸ˜Š
